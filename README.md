# ♻️ EcoClassify Vision – AI Waste Segregation System

**An AI-powered real-time waste classification system using just a webcam – built as part of our Summer Internship Capstone Project.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**EcoClassify Vision** addresses the growing challenge of improper waste disposal by providing a smart, affordable, and scalable solution. Using a simple webcam and a deep learning model, the system can identify waste items in **six categories**:

- 🥫 Plastic  
- 🪙 Metal  
- 🍌 Organic  
- 📰 Paper  
- 🔋 Battery  
- 🧪 Glass  

The model is trained using image data and deployed with **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow Lite** for real-time classification, all running on **low-cost consumer devices** without special hardware. The project promotes proper recycling, reduces pollution, and supports a cleaner environment.
